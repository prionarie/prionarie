## Hello, CommuGITy!
My name is Fionah.<br>
I'm in college right now studying IT. A degree is great and all but I need to learn by myself if I want to keep up with the rest of the world. So, I'm here to expand my education and experiences - maybe find new opportunities. The beauty of being in this field is the possibilities. I'm still in the process of finding out what I specialize in but 'm up for anything!
