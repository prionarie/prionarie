## Hello, CommuGITy!
My name is Fionah.<br>
I'm studying BSIT in college. A degree is great and all but I need to learn by myself if I want to keep up with the rest of the world. So, I'm here to expand my education and experiences - maybe find new opportunities. The beauty of being in this field is the possibilities. I aspire to be a backend developer!
